## Description
This is a simple text editor, made in the C Programming Language.
It works in the terminal.
It is not perfect, it is just something I did for fun.
## Usage:
- Open it through the terminal with 1 argument: the file you want to open for editing
- Press arrow keys to navigate
- Press "Enter" to create a new line
- Press "Backspace" to delete a character
- Press Ctrl+W to save to a file called "file.txt"
## ! Important !
The program only works with ASCII characters.
